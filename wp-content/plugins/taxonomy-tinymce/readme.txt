=== Notes === 
- This plugin needs at least WordPress 3.3 to work as it uses the new wp_editor call introduced in WP 3.3.
- This plugin is a inspired by [CategoryTinyMCE](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/categorytinymce/) and [WooDojo](http://www.woothemes.com/woodojo/).

== Installation ==

1. Upload Taxonomy-TinyMCE folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory or install via Plugin screen within WordPress.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to your custom taxonomy edit pages and start to write!
